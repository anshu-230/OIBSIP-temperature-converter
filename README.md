# OIBSIP-temperature-converter
A temperature converter is a tool or application that allows you to convert temperatures between different temperature scales. The most commonly used temperature scales are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). The primary purpose of a temperature converter is to help users easily convert temperatures from one scale to another. This can be useful when working with temperature-related data, traveling to countries that use a different temperature scale, or when comparing temperatures in scientific.
Common Temperature Scales:

Celsius (°C): This is the metric temperature scale, with 0°C representing the freezing point of water and 100°C representing the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure.
Fahrenheit (°F): This is the temperature scale commonly used in the United States. It has 32°F as the freezing point of water and 212°F as the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure.
Kelvin (K): The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale often used in scientific research. It starts from absolute zero (0 K), which is equivalent to -273.15°C or -459.67°F.
